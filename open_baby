**Dear [شيزا],**

I hope this letter finds you in good health. I must express my deepest apologies for my insensitive jokes and words. I realize they have caused you pain, and for that, I am sincerely remorseful.

Please understand that it was never my intention to cause you distress. I am dedicated to making amends. I never wanted to hurt you, my dear; I was merely trying to bring a smile to your face. I was oblivious to the struggles you were facing, and for that, I am profoundly sorry.

I comprehend if you require time and space, yet I wish to convey that I am present, willing to listen, and resolve this together. Isolation may only lead to further misunderstandings, so let's discuss it.

My dear, if there is anything troubling you, please share it with me.

With all my love,

**[فرخان]**
